# MIS331Project

Final Project for my Intermediate Java Course at Iowa State with another team member.
Our project was to build a CLI payroll system to add, update/edit, delete Employees, add hours, and print checks to the console.
The database is a txt file where each attribute of an Employee is maintained by a row.
